Want to know how to contact us? Ways are multiple ;-)

And depending on needs:

* you can use [Matrix](#matrix) (or [IRC](#irc)) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/98g2e3xka8) channels for any subject, or just to say hello,
* you can also talk about everything on [mailing lists](#mailing-lists) but prefer development list to talk about... development,
* for a bug report or an enhancement request, use the bug tracker,
* you can also propose a new way, if that makes sense.

On social networks (Mastodon, Twitter), doing support or explain some things can be complicated... We prefer any other of the provided channels as much as possible.

## Instant messaging

Ask a question, and get an answer. It's simple and effective. It only requires someone in front to answer you, and this is where things may get a bit complicated :D

It may happen that instant messaging is not really instant, depending on every one and the context... Main developer is globally always present from time to time.

### Matrix

Matrix is a quite recent communication protocol, which aims to be open and interoperable. It operates almost like IRC, with the difference you will first have to create a Matrix account, to join Galette discussion room.

* Matrix room: [#galette:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#galette:matrix.org)
* and community: [+galette:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/+galette:matrix.org)

Room is accessible for everyone, archives are not public, you will just have access to the discussion which will happen after you've joined.
It is automatically linked to the official IRC channel, you do not have anything more to do.

### Discord

You can also join [Galette Discord](https://discord.gg/98g2e3xka8) channel :)

### IRC

IRC is a communication protocol that does exist from years (1988), which does well what we ask it (not much finally), and which is still widespread.

All you need is an IRC client to connect to [irc.oftc.net](irc://irc.oftc.net) and then join `#galette`.

Note than when your IRC client is closed or just not connected, no message will be sent to you. And you will never be able to see what you've missed (no log of the IRC channel is available).

Recently, a bridge between IRC channel and Matrix room has been created; this should bring a solution to this problem. Indeed, this is the Matrix instance which connects to IRC in that case for all participants.

## Mailing lists

Mailing lists are a set of discussion by email. The list has an email address to which you can send message that are then delivered to all its subscribers (yourself included).

In order to send or receive messages from the list, you **absolutely must be subscribed to it**. The process is explained on list page itself and below on this page.

Available lists:

* [users](https://lists.mailman3.com/postorius/lists/galette-users.mailman3.com/): global discussions, help, FAQ
* [development](https://lists.mailman3.com/postorius/lists/galette-devel.mailman3.com/): developer mailing list for more technical subjects

### Subscription/Unsubscription and usage

To subscribe to one of the mailing list, you have several options (see above links):
* from web UI, create an account on mailman3 and then subscribe to lists you want to;
* from web UI, just subscribe with your email;
* send an email to the administrative address.

You can also view and search in lists archives; or even send new messages or answer an existing one using the web UI:
* [for users list](https://lists.mailman3.com/hyperkitty/list/galette-users@mailman3.com/),
* [for development list](https://lists.mailman3.com/hyperkitty/list/galette-devel@mailman3.com/).

### Old archives

Since 2024-03-01, we use a new mailing list system.

The most simple and reliable way to [search on past Galette related discussion](https://www.mail-archive.com/search?l=all&q=galette&a=1) is to make a query on mail archive services.

## Bugs reports and requests for enhancement
