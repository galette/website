And also:

* CSV imports now handles dynamic fields and already encrypted passwords
* Send invoice/receipt or membercard direct download links in emails
* Offer last months when using beginning of membership date
* Members can print their own invoices/receipts
* Possibility to use memberâ€™s deadline instead of year in PDF cards

Some bugs have also been fixed; including PHP 7.4 and CSV import issues among others. See [Galette 0.9.4 changelog]({{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/master/changelog.html#v094) for all details.

A big work has been done under the hood; the code has been cleaned and reorganized a bit, unit tests has been added and more work has been done on code quality.

All official plugins, as well as documentation can now be [translated](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/galette) in the same languages as Galette itself! Setting up all that was a big work, but even if this has been done very recently, translations have already started :-)

Most of the plugins have also been updated, please refer to [plugins documentation]({{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/master/plugins/) to know more ;-)
