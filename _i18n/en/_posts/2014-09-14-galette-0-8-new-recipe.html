<p>It's been 6 month since last Galette was released...</p>


<p>During this time, even if I became dad another time, I've worked on some important changes provided in this new release:</p>
<ul>
<li>complete rewrite of the installation process, more pleasant and logic for the users, and much more flexible for developpers,</li>
<li>use of database component to its new major release, the old one is no longer supported,</li>
<li>PHP 5.4 as minimum version,</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>Some bugs have been fixed, and some other improvements have been implemented, please take a look at the <a href="{{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/master/changelog.html#v080" hreflang="fr">complete changelog</a>. All plugins have also been updated, since old versions will not work with that new Galette.</p>

<p>This new progress in the projet closes 0.7 series that has been started early 2012, after some time of good and faithful services - well... I hope!</p>


<p>I now have to recover from all that ;)</p>
