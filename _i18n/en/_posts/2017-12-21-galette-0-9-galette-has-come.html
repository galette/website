<p>Even if changes are numerous for this release (which EOL 0.8 series), no database upgrade is required if you're runnig an up to date 0.8 :-)</p>

<p>I'd like to thank very much every one that has been involved in this release! And a very, very big thanks for those who tests candidate releases and have filled bugs that I have fixed.</p>
