On May 18th, 2007, I officially took the ownership of Galette project. Today, 17 years after, I'm very happy to announce the second release candidate of next Galette version!  

Several issues have been fixes since rc1.

The new 1.1.0 release fix some issues, but also brings some new features and improvements:

* Add amounts on contributions types 
* Check if new Galette version is available
* Manage administrative documents
* Dispatch contribution into scheduled payments
* Prevent instance indexation from search engines bots
* Add payment type on transactions
* ...

Database schema has changed since 1.0 series, do not forget to backup your database! Keep in mind this is a RC release, you should avoid using it in a production environment.

See [Galette 1.1.0 changelog]({{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/develop/changelog.html#v1100) for all details.

All plugins needs to be updated as well, use the nightly archive available for each one, see [plugins documentation]({{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/develop/plugins/) ;-)
