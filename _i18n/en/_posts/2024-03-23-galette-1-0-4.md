- Number of show member automatically set to “all”
- Groups modification not visually added on member form
- Fix redirection when dynamic file does not exist
- Menu horizontal scroll when name is too long
- Should not select a member as its own parent
- Add preferences footer in replacements

See [Galette 1.0.4 changelog]({{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/master/changelog.html#v1040) for all details.

This will probably be the latest release on 1.0 series, I'd like to concentrate on 1.1 now.

Hope you will enjoy this release; happy Galette!
