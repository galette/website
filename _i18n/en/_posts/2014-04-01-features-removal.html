<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Obviously, nobody can believe such thing, it was an April Fool.</p>

<p>Working on a software like Galette take a lot of time, and I have less time each week. It was an urgent need to find features that take too much time adn to remove them.</p>


<p>Mailings are very complex; and Galette is not designed to be a mailing system, I terefore decided to remove this feature.</p>


<p>Dynamic fields are way too complex as well, and will be removed too.</p>


<p>It's not everyday, those removals will be in the next Galette release, but also in the current one. That means than starting now, people who download Galette 0.7.8 will no longer benefit of those features.</p>
