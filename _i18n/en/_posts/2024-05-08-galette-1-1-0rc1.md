I'm very pleased to announce Galette is on the road to the 1.1.0 release!

This new release fix some issues, but also brings some new features and improvements.

* Add amounts on contributions types 
* Check if new Galette version is available
* Manage administrative documents
* Dispatch contribution into scheduled payments
* Prevent instance indexation from search engines bots
* Add payment type on transactions
* ...

Database schema has changed, do not forget to backup your database! Keep in mind this is a RC release, you should avoid using it in a production environment.

See [Galette 1.1.0 changelog]({{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/develop/changelog.html#v1100) for all details.

All plugins needs to be updated as well, use the nightly archive available for each one, see [plugins documentation]({{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/develop/plugins/) ;-)
