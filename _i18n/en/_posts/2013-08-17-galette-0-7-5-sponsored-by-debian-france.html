<p><a href="https://france.debian.net/" hreflang="fr">Debian France nonprofit organization</a>, who promotes the Debian operating system and myself, are proud to present you <a href="https://galette.eu/download/archives/galette-0.7.5.tar.bz2">Galette 0.7.5</a>!</p>


<p>After a few months of work, a few difficulties, hard work and meticulous tests; a new sponsored version was born.
As a reminder, a "Sponsored release" means that some developments have been paid via my self-employment activity and reversed to the community.</p>


<p>Debian France requests were about distinct things:</p>
<ul>
<li>subscriptions reminder emails (<a href="https://bugs.galette.eu/issues/368">#368</a>), scheduled via cron (<a href="https://bugs.galette.eu/issues/377">#377</a>)</li>
<li>reminders email templates (<a href="https://bugs.galette.eu/issues/376">#376</a>)</li>
<li>customizable invoices and receipts (<a href="https://bugs.galette.eu/issues/394">#394</a>)</li>
<li>contribution storage in accounting via an external script (<a href="https://bugs.galette.eu/issues/490">#490</a>) when adding a new contribution from Galette or Paypal plugin.</li>
</ul>

<p>Very special thanks to Guillaume Rousse, who implemented some additionnal features:</p>
<ul>
<li>add date/year dynamic fields type (<a href="https://bugs.galette.eu/issues/191">#191</a>)</li>
<li>add boolean dynamic fields type (<a href="https://bugs.galette.eu/issues/624">#624</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>A few other enhancements were brought along, and some bugs were fixed; see <a href="https://bugs.galette.eu/versions/36" hreflang="fr">complete change log</a>.</p>


<p>Again, many thanks to Debian France for their sponsoring, and also to everyone who were involved in improving and testing this release :-)</p>
