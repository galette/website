A few new pages/accounts for Galette have been created on social networks.

You now can find Galette on:
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/galettesoft)
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/galette/)
* [Discord](https://discord.gg/98g2e3xka8)

Of course, you can still follow us on [Mastodon](https://framapiaf.org/@galette) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/galette_soft).

This is a kind of test, to see what would be used.

See you soon!
