<p>AFUL and I are really proud to present you that new Galette release, which is quite special... Indeed, that is the first sponsored version.</p>


<p><a href="http://aful.org/" hreflang="fr">AFUL is a french non profit organization dedicated to FOSS and open standards promotion</a>.</p>


<p>But what is a "Sponsored version"?<br />
A version that contains developments paid by someone and reversed to the community. TThe AFUL has been this someone for the present release and this via <a href="http://x-tnd.be" hreflang="fr">my self-employment activity</a>.</p>


<p>All Galette users (who are the first to benefit from this) and I would like to say a very big thanks to AFUL for their participation. It allows Galette to keep improving and show a real, practical example of a FOSS project development! Bravo!</p>
