<p>After long development months, here is the first public release candidate for Galette 0.9!</p>


<p>This new major release brings, along with some bugfixes, some <a href="http://galette.readthedocs.io/fr/develop/changelog.html#id2" hreflang="fr">new features</a> I invite you to discover testing this release :-)</p>


<p>Even if this is a major release, no changes has been done to the database; you "only" have to update your files!</p>


<p>As this is a test version, download links and documentation still refers to current stable (0.8.3.4); <a href="http://galette.readthedocs.io/fr/develop/" hreflang="fr">a specific documentation version for Galette 0.9</a> has been put on the readthedocs platform; even if most of the old documentation is still acurate.</p>


<p>Note that this new release make plugins incompatibles.... Official plugins maps, paypal, fullcard and auto have already been migrated; you can test them downloading the ZIP file of their develop branch on github.</p>


<p>Do not hesitate to test this new release, and give me feebdbacks; on <a href="/dc/index.php/pages/Contact">the mailing lists</a> or on the <a href="http://bugs.galette.eu/projects/galette/">le tracker</a> :-)</p>
