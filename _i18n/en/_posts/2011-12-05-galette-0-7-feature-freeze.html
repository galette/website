<p>As that was recently announced, <a href="http://goo.gl/flGvC" hreflang="fr">features for future 0.7 version of Galette has been freezed</a> :-)</p>


<p>That means development team will no longer accept new features fort these version; and that it will dedicate more time to bugfix, code stabilization and improve the <a href="http://galette.tuxfamily.org/documentation/">new documentation</a>.</p>


<p>Refer to <a href="http://galette.tuxfamily.org/documentation/fr/changelog.html" hreflang="fr">0.7 changelog</a> from its illustrious ancestors (Galettes that are probalby not so so fresh acually :-p) to know what this new recipe brings.</p>
