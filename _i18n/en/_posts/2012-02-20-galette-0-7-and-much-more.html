<p>Galette 0.7 was on the road for some time now. Bugs and tasks announced for this version are fixed; older versions migration works also.</p>


<p>So, this is with a real pleasure that I inform you of the New Galette's version 0.7 release :-) For the occasion, the project has been freshened up (new website, new documentation, new bug and tasks tracker, use of Git instead of Subversion).</p>


<p>You can get this release at:<br />
<a href="http://download.tuxfamily.org/galette/archives/galette-0.7.0.tar.bz2">http://download.tuxfamily.org/galette/archives/galette-0.7.0.tar.bz2</a></p>


<p>Numerous functionnalities and changes have been made for this release, some problems may have slipped through our vigilance, feel free to report them using Galette's trackers|https://bugs.galette.eu/projects/galette/]!</p>


<p>A most <a href="{{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/master/changelog.html#v070">complete list of Galette 0.7 new functionnalities</a> is available on the documentation.</p>


<p>If you are updating, <strong>make sure to backup your data</strong> ; I do not have any old Galette installations, so I cannot test much upgrades scripts.</p>


<p><a href="{{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/master/">Galette's documentation</a> also has been rewritten.<br />
The user guide is not yet ended, and I unfortunately can not spend more time to take care of that for now (by the way, if you're interested in helping with that, I'll not say no); on the other hand, installation manual is up-to-date:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="Installation guide{{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/master/installation/index.html" title="Installation guide{{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/master/installation/index.html">Installation guidehttp://galette.tu...</a></li>
<li><a href="{{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/master/usermanual/index.html">user guide</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Galette 0.7 brings the ability to <a href="{{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/master/plugins/index.html">add functionality using additional plugins</a>.</p>


<p>On a more technical note, <a href="{{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/master/development/index.html">developper's guide</a> was born for this new release :-)</p>


<p>Old documentation will be gracefully retired, until that, please be carefull not to get the wrong one ;)</p>


<p>A big thank you to everyone who participated in this release! :-)</p>
