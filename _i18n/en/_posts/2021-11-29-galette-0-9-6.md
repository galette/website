This is a major release, which brings a few new features and bugfixes as usual, but this one also fix some security issues (CVE-2021-41262, CVE-2021-41261, CVE-2021-41260).

**Upgrade is highly recommended.**

* Social networks/contact externalization
* Add member number
* Export contributions as CSV
* Drop group name uniqueness at same level
* Add CSRF protection
* Enhance groups managers capacities
* ...

See [Galette 0.9.6 changelog]({{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/master/changelog.html#v0960) for all details.

Unfortunately, some required background changes (CSRF checks) has made almost all plugins incompatible, and it is required to update them, see [plugins documentation]({{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/master/plugins/) ;-)
