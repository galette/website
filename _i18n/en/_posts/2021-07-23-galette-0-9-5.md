A very big thanks as well to everyone involved in this release, especially:
- Weblate contributors, many translations have been done,
- community members who do tests during the development phases, many issues has been fixed,
- ...

This is a major release, which brings a few new features and bugfixes as usual, but this one also fix some security issues (CVE-2021-21319).

* PDF and emails variables homogenisation; add variables for dynamic fields,
* Add dynamic files on contributions and transactions
* Rework database fields length

Some bugs have also been fixed; including PHP 8.0 issues among others. See [Galette 0.9.5 changelog]({{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/master/changelog.html#v095) for all details.

Unfortunately, some required background changes (on dependency injection library) has made all plugins incompatible, and it is required to update them, see [plugins documentation]({{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/master/plugins/) ;-)
