<p>Versions follow one after the other and are all very different...</p>


<p>Sponsors follow one after the other and are all very different... ;-)</p>


<p>This time, it's Loïs (GruiicK) Taulelle, as a private individual, who sponsors nothing less than CSV import feature!<br />
Loïs is the original creator of Galette (along with  Frédéric Jacquot, aka Deelight), and was the main maintainer until I took over the project in 2007. He has never stopped following it, often contributing in several ways (he takes care of PostgreSQL install scripts, published several news on LinuxFr, etc.).</p>


<p>This new Galette release ships some other features along with CSV imports, I let you check out <a href="{{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/master/changelog.html">the changelog</a>. <a href="{{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/master/usermanual/adherents.html#csv-imports">CSV imports are already welld coumented </a> (the sponsoring effet).</p>


<p>A very big thank to Loïs to made possible implementation of this new, and often asked, feature :-)</p>
