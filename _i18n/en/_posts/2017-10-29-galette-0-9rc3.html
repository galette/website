<p>After a few weeks... Here is a <a href="http://download.tuxfamily.org/galette/dev/galette-0.9-rc3-20171029-56999c78ef.tar.bz2">third public test release for Galette 0.9</a>!</p>


<p>Once again, I'd like to thank every person involved in testing the previous version; <a href="https://bugs.galette.eu/projects/galette/issues?query_id=13">declared bugs has of course been fixed</a> in this new release!</p>


<p>Appart of those fixes; Galette 0.9 now has a system to send some data and to register. The goal is to retrieve some (<strong>anonymous!</strong>) useful informations on Galette usages. You can find <a href="{{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/develop/usermanual/generalites.html#telemetry" hreflang="fr">more informations on telemetry in the documentation</a>.</p>


<p>Reminder...</p>


<p>This new major release brings, along with some bugfixes, some <a href="{{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/develop/changelog.html#id2" hreflang="fr">new features</a> I invite you to discover testing this release :-)</p>


<p>Even if this is a major release, no changes has been done to the database; you "only" have to update your files!</p>


<p>Note that this new release make plugins incompatibles.... Official plugins maps, paypal, fullcard and auto have already been migrated; you can test them downloading the ZIP file of their develop branch on github.</p>
