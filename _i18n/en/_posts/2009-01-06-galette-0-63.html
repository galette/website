<p>The Galette Team is glad to announce the release of <a href="https://download.tuxfamily.org/galette/archives/galette-0.63.tgz">Galette 0.63</a>!</p>


<p>For those who don't know Galette yet, it is a Project to manage the members of your association. Galette is a Free software, licensed under the GPL licence. In French, Galette means Extremely Sophisticated but so Efficient On-Line Membership Manager (in French, a "Galette" is a sort of cake, usually French people eats the "Galette des rois" for the Epiphany).</p>


<p>Here are the updates for the new version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added transaction management,</li>
<li>Added dynamic fields management, to add more fields and to translate their labels easily,</li>
<li>Members can now self subscribe to your association,</li>
<li>Use of the Smarty template engine, for which the rewriting of all the html pages as compliant XHTML was necessary,</li>
<li>Update ADODB 4.7.1 to 4.9.2,</li>
<li>Use of gettext for translations,</li>
<li>Added Spanish translation (the translation is not yet over),</li>
<li>It is now possible to upload a personal logo,</li>
<li>So much bugs corrections.</li>
</ul>
