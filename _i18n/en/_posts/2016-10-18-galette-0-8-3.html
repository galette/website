<p>The new Galette release, 0.8.3, is now available to download!</p>


<p>Some news, some bug fixes at program of this new version. You can check the <a href="{{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/master/changelog.html#v083" hreflang="fr">complete changelog</a> to know more.</p>


<p>It will be the last release of the 0.8 serie, which means I will not add new features before 0.9 will be published (which is alredy at work for a while, but still requires some work).</p>


<p>Soon, develop branches of Galette and its plugins will switch to 0.9, and will probably be broken; as well as nigthly release.</p>


<p>Documentation will probably follow, but I have to find some motivation :D</p>


<p>Next... Later !</p>


<p>Waiting for that, you can test the latest release, use mailing lists and also donate (there is a button just at the right! :p).</p>
