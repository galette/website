<p>Months, even years of intensive developments; several candidates releases, a very hard work... And now Galette 0.9 begins!</p>


<p>Changelog for this release is quite long, I invite you to <a href={{ site.galette.doc_url }}/{{ site.lang }}/master/changelog.html#id2" hreflang="fr">check the full changelog</a> for details.</p>


<p>Even if changes are numerous for this release (which EOL 0.8 series), no database upgrade is required if you're runnig an up to date 0.8 :-)</p>


<p>Around this version, several services has been provided:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://telemetry.galette.eu/">a Telemetry app</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>And of course, all existing communication channels (<a href="/dc/index.php/pages/Contact">mailing lists</a>, <a href="/dc/index.php/pages/Contact">IRC channel</a>, <a href="https://bugs.galette.eu/projects/galette">tracker</a>, ...) are still available.</p>

<p>I'd like to thank very much every one that has been involved in this release! And a very, very big thanks for those who tests candidate releases and have filled bugs that I have fixed.</p>


<p>I wish you all a merry Xmas and a very happy new year!</p>
