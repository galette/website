<p>A security flaw has been recently identified for 0.63 versions of Galette (<a href="http://redmine.ulysses.fr/issues/250">http://redmine.ulysses.fr/issues/250</a> - CVE-2012-2338).</p>


<p><strong>Updating your Galette version or the file that fix the flaw is strongly encouraged.</strong></p>


<p>This vulnerability impacts all 0.63s Galette versions. Galette 0.7 as well as current development version are not concerned.</p>


<p>Problem has been solved, and a 0.63.4 version of Galette is available (changes concerns only the flaw):<br />

<p>Only one file must be changed on all concerned versions; you can <a href="http://goo.gl/eICiy">get it here</a> and replace the existing one in your installation (that way you do not need to upgrade the full code).</p>


<p>Please note that it is the very last change on 0.6x series (that are now EOL): development, support, etc for those versions will be discarded,</p>


<p>Galette 0.7 is now out from several months (and the <a href="http://goo.gl/YPZ94">next release is already on the rails</a>); we strongly encourage you to update your old version ;)</p>
